# MeEnsina APP üöÄ

MeEnsina is a social application. Our goal is to help students study in groups or participate in monitoring. Unlike distance learning, our focus is to motivate students to have face-to-face meetings. In Brazil, for example, there are many students who drop out of continuing to attend higher education because of lack of motivation or difficulty in learning. As, for example, a teacher can not accompany all students, just as there are those who because of the fear, avoid doubting with teachers.

The operation of the application is very simple and requires only the registration and login of the user and he will already have access to available monitors as well as groups. When participating in a monotiria, it will be aided (free) by another student in the learning of a certain subject. When opting for groups, it can have access to people who wish to learn about one or several topics as well as share experiences.

Within the University, despite having hundreds of students, many do not have the opportunity to communicate with other students. Through MeEnsina, let's break these limits and create a free sharing of knowledge and experience! With this, we will be motivating the community to work more in a team and develop new ways of learning and exchanging content.

The application can be downloaded for free at Playstore and soon we will also be making it available for iOs and Web.
